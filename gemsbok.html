    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. 
        Previously, some sources classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>
        <p>Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m (4 ft) at the shoulder. The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm (18 to 35 in). Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240 kg (400 and 530 lb), while females weigh 100–210 kg (220–460 lb).</p>
        <p>Gemsbok are found in arid and semi-arid bushlands in southwestern Africa, especially around the Namib and Kalahari deserts, in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and formerly Angola (where they are considered extirpated).Drinking with a group of helmeted guineafowl in the foreground</p>
        <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
        <p>You will find the Gemsbok at the Panda Canyon, right next to the Dine at the zoo.</p>
