    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.Skull</p>
    <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, a warthog's body and head appear largely bare, from a distance, with only a crest of hair along the back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious.</p>
    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
        <p>You will find the Warthogs at the Panda Canyon, right next to the Elephants.</p>
